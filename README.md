# poly-fit
Strict polynomial fitting in Rust.  Least squares regression coming soon! 

__Limitations:__
Designed to return an EXACT function.  Ex [1,2,4,9] will return `y=x^2`, but [1,2,3,4,5,100] will NOT return `y=x`.  Use my eventual least squares package in stead lol. 

### Usage:
- to be decided
